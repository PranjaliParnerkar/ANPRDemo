# ANPRDemo
Problem Statement — Our client, a leading textile manufacturer faced various security related issues on their site. Through a detailed assessment of the site, it was noticed that the operating modules lacked standardization and monitoring of the same was done manually. They also had a significantly large amount of man-guarding coupled with underutilization of the said resources with little to no accountability. Through the integration of tech with the mobile application, it was possible to track the daily activities and provide the same information through a maker checker concept for further validation of processes.
Let’s for now focus only on the tracking of vehicles through mobile application. This was done by the security workforce deployed at every checkpoint where they were responsible to capture the picture of every vehicle’s number plate on entry and exit through the mobile app. To detect the license plate, we made use of an AI based Indian license plate detector.
